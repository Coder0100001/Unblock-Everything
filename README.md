If you have only an extension:

1. Locate your extension id by clicking the extension icon in the top right of your browser image, find your extension, click the 3 dots, then click "Manage Extension". Copy everything after chrome://extensions?id=. That is your extension id.
2. Create 2 new bookmarks IN YOUR BOOKMARK BAR, one named kill with a URL of chrome://kill and one named hang with a URL of chrome://hang.
3. Open a new tab and go to chrome-extension://yourextensionidhere/manifest.json but replace "yourextensionidhere" with the id from earlier.
4. Okay, you're going to want to remember this entire step and do it quickly. Click the kill bookmark from earlier and quickly spam the hang bookmark and spam the reload button on your keyboard for about 3-ish seconds.
Optional. Pin the current tab (optional). DO NOT CLOSE THIS TAB OR IT WILL STOP WORKING. THE TAB WILL RELOAD FOREVER.
You have done basic LTMEAT! Enjoy your freedom.

If you have an extension AND a wifi blocker (if above didnt work alone):
(Note: you still must use the method above than after use this along with the other one. This part of the tutorial will only work on chromebooks if the above tutorial didn't work you're out of luck sorry.)

1. Complete all the steps in the "If you have only an extension" tutorial. You are done, but you will need to reconnect to the VPN every time you close your chromebook.
2. Download the VPN from this repository.
3. Visit this link (copy and paste into new tab): chrome://settings/signOut
4. Visit this [link](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession). Sign into your school or work account.
5. Visit this link (copy and paste into new tab): chrome://network
6. Scroll down to the “Import ONC file” option.
7. Choose the “Import” option.
8. Select the VPN file you downloaded.
9. Go to your Chromebook settings 
10. Click “VPN”.
11. Find and choose the “US CABBAGE” network. (Note: you may not be abl to connect immediatly as the vpn is still processing your account please wait 5 to 10 minutes and repeat this step if this is the case)

Final Notes:
1. Do not close the killed tab. The tab will forever reload, ignore this.
2. You will need to redo the tutorial if your chromebook gets shut down. (E.g it dies or you sign out)
3. You will need to reconnect to the VPN every time you close your chromebook. (I know this is annoying, sorry, but it is necessary.)
